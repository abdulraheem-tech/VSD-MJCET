Design and Test Bench
Design: Actual Verilog code (may span multiple files) representing the hardware's intended functionality.
Test Bench (TB): A Verilog module that instantiates the design, applies stimulus (test vectors), and observes outputs to validate the designâ€™s behavior.
The test bench does not have primary inputs or outputs; these are properties of the design under test.
The TB generates input stimuli and monitors output responses internally.
